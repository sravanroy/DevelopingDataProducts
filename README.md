# Dynamic Regression Analysis

> Predict the average rating of board games. The data is scraped online and can be found [here](https://github.com/sravanroy/sravanroy.github.io/blob/master/datasets/board_game_predictor/games.csv)

> Choose your own regression fit and train/test split to run regression analysis on the data

> Enhanced interpretibility for models by looking at individual residual plots and parameters and better decisive power for final model

### The Shiny Application is hosted at <https://sravanroy.shinyapps.io/Different_Regression_Analyses/>
